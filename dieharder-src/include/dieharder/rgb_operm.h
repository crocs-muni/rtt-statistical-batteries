# formed from a long string of samples.  The difference is expected\n\
# to have a chisq distribution and hence can be transformed into a\n\
# sample p-value.  Note that this is one possible functional replacement\n\
# for the broken/defunct diehard operm5 test, but one that permits k (the\n\
# number of numbers in the overlapping permutation window) to be varied\n\
# from 2 to perhaps 8.\n\
