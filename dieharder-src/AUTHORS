Many other individuals have contributed to dieharder at this point by
pointing out bugs or probable errors, by contributing improved
statistical targets or fragments of code or random number generators to
add.  I do not include a full list of their names here to protect them
from the responsibilities of maintaining the code and their privacy, but
I do try to acknowledge them in the actual code source that they've most
affected.  Please feel free to join the dieharder development mailing
list at
