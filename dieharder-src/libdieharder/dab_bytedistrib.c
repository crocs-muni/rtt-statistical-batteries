 *                        DAB Byte Distribution Test
 *
 * Extract n independent bytes from each of k consecutive words. Increment
 * indexed counters in each of n tables.  (Total of 256 * n counters.)
 * Currently, n=3 and is fixed at compile time.
 * If n>=2, then the lowest and highest bytes will be used, along
 * with n-2 bytes from the middle.
 * If the generator's word size is too small, overlapped bytes will
 * be used.
 * Current, k=3 and is fixed at compile time.
 * Use a basic chisq fitting test (chisq_pearson) for the p-value.
 * Previous version also used a chisq independence test (chisq2d); it
 * was found to be slightly less sensitive.
 * I envisioned this test as using a small number of samples and large
 * number of separate tests. Experiments so far show that keeping -p 1
 * and increasing -t performs best.
