============================================================================
What is new in version TestU01-1.2.1
------------------------------------

** This version contains only small corrections. It eliminates warnings for
   extreme values in probability distributions and protects against arguments
   that could give overflows on some compilers for a few calls to pow and exp
   functions.



============================================================================
What is new in version TestU01-1.2
------------------------------------

** Module probdist/fdist, fbar: replaced the bivariate normal distribution
   fdist_BiNormal1 and fbar_BiNormal1 with a better algorithm due to Donnelly.

** Module testu01/unif01: new filter unif01_CreateParallelGen to test parallel
   generators or multiple streams of a generator.

** Module testu01/ucrypto: new cryptographic generators based on SHA-1 and on AES.

** Module testu01/ubrent: added the new version (2006) of Brent's xorgens RNGs.

** Module testu01/sknuth_Run test:   bug correction:
   n random numbers are now generated instead of the incorrect n+1 in previous
   versions. The coefficients of the inverse covariance matrix A have been com-
   puted with better precision. The new version of the run test in Knuth (3rd ed.)
   is now used. Thanks to Paul C. Leopardi for these corrections.


============================================================================
What is new in version TestU01-1.1
------------------------------------

** Module testu01/bbattery: Changed the parameters of 1 birthday spacings test
   in bbattery_Crush and in bbattery_BigCrush in the case of 32-bit machines.

** Module testu01/u*: Added the modules uxorshift and ubrent implementing some
   xorshift generators.



============================================================================
What is new in version TestU01-1.0
------------------------------------

** Module testu01/bbattery: Changed the parameters of some tests in 
   bbattery_Crush and bbattery_BigCrush.
   Added many new tests in bbattery_BigCrush.

** Module testu01/s*: all tests that use normal or chi-square distributions
   now have additionnal tests based on the sum of the N replicated statistics.
   These statistics are calculated in module sres.

** Module testu01/smarsa: renamed the Monkey test as the CAT test, and
   MonkeyBits test as the CATBits test.

** Module testu01/usoft: Added generators of well-known softwares.

** Module testu01/unif01: Added the luxury filter unif01_CreateLuxGen.

** Module testu01/umrg: umrg_CreateLagFib has one more parameter and is
   more general than the last version.

** Module testu01/ulec: L'Ecuyer's MRG32k3a is implemented with 64-bit integers
   in ulec_CreateMRG32k3aL.

** Module testu01/ulcg: Added Payne's et al. fast implementation 
   ulcg_CreateLCGPayne for linear congruential generator with m = 2^31 - 1.

** Module probdist/fdist, finv: added the symmetrical Beta distribution.

** Module probdist/fdist, fbar, finv: improved some distributions in the
   far tails.

** Module probdist/fdist, fbar:  added a better approximation of the
   Gamma distribution for very large parameter.

** Module probdist/fdist, fbar: added the bivariate normal distributions  
   BiNormal1, BiNormal2

** Module probdist/fmass: added fmass_BinomialTerm3 and fmass_BinomialTerm4.

** Module probdist/gofw: added the values gofw_Var and gofw_Sum in type 
   gofw_TestType


============================================================================
What is new in version TestU01-0.6.1
------------------------------------

** Module testu01/bbattery, bbattery_Crush:   bug correction
   in tests 92 and 94 (sstring_AutoCor with N = 1), the wrong index was 
   used to access the array of p-values: the printed p-values were meaningless.

** Module testu01/s*.c: now print the number of degrees of freedom with 
   the results of a test when the statistic obeys a chi-square law.
   (Thanks to Brian Wichmann and David Hill for this suggestion)

** Module probdist/fdist, fdist_Beta:   bug correction
   for some values of  p, q ~ 1000, the last elements of the recurrences
   underflowed and the function returned 0 instead of the correct value.



============================================================================
What is new in version TestU01-0.6.0
------------------------------------

** Module mylib/gdef: Added new macros in gdef.tex and removed some others.

** Module mylib/gdef: Added the macros PRIdLEAST64 and PRIuLEAST64 in 
gdef.tex and use them in a few files to correctly print 64-bit integers
(although these macros are part of the new ISO C99 standard).

** Module mylib/chrono.c: Fixed a bug in chrono.c. 
The chrono timers sometimes returned negative CPU times under Cygwin. 
The number of clock ticks was put in a 32-bit integer which overflowed. 
Now a 64-bit integer is used.

-------------------
** Modules probdist/fmass, fdist, fbar: Compute the Poisson, the binomial
and some continuous probability distributions with better accuracy far in
the tails.

** Module probdist/fbar: Added the fbar_LogNormal, fbar_JohnsonSB, 
fbar_JohnsonSU probability distributions.

** Modules probdist/fdist, finv: Added Marsaglia's et al fast method for 
the CDF of the normal probability distribution in fdist_Normal4, and his 
method for the inverse normal distribution in finv_Normal2.

** Module probdist/fdist: Added Marsaglia's Anderson-Darling distribution
in fdist_AndersonDarling2. 

** Module probdist/finv: Added a fast method for the inversion of the 
symmetrical beta distribution in finv_BetaSymmetric.

-------------------
** Module testu01/bbattery: Changed some parameters for some tests in 
bbattery_SmallCrush, bbattery_Crush, bbattery_BigCrush. Added several new
tests in bbattery_Crush and bbattery_BigCrush.

** Module testu01/bbattery: Added the functions bbattery_Repeat* that make
it very easy to repeat one of more tests from the predefined batteries of
tests.

** Modules testu01/u*: Some predefined generators in the u modules did not
work correctly on 64-bit machines because they explicitly assume long int 
of 32 bits. This has been corrected and they should work consistently on 
all machines.

** Module testu01/umarsa: Added several new generators proposed by George
Marsaglia.

** Module testu01/unif01: Added two functions that will make it very easy to
test generators that are not pre-programmed in TestU01:
unif01_CreateExternGen01 and unif01_CreateExternGenBits.
