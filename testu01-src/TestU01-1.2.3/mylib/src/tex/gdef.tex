\defmodule {gdef}

Platform-dependent options are defined here.
These options are used by other modules to decide when 
platform-dependent functions must be commented out or not.
Most of these options are set to their true values by the program
{\it configure} in the installation process. The user may choose
to set some of them manually.
\iffalse
Each option must either be left undefined (i.e., the corresponding
macro is put to false, using ``\texttt{\#undef}) 
or can be given its proper value (using ``\texttt{\#define} commands).
An option can be defined only under certain conditions.
For example, \texttt{USE\_GMP} can be defined only if GMP
is available, \texttt{HAVE\_ERF} can be defined only if the Unix \texttt{erf}
function is available, and so on.
\fi
This module also contains a function that prints the current host name.

  they are defined correctly in the following \texttt{typedef}. Otherwise,
  undefine this macro.

  \texttt{long long} and \texttt{unsigned long long} may exist and be called 
  by different names.
  The macros \texttt{PRIdLEAST64} and \texttt{PRIuLEAST64} are defined 
  in the ISO C99 standard in order to print \emph{signed} 
  and \emph{unsigned}  64-bit integers, respectively.
   Define them correctly if they are not already defined, otherwise 
  comment them out.

#if ULONG_MAX == 4294967295UL
#define IS_ULONG32
#endif

  \tab This macro is defined if type \texttt {unsigned long} has
  exactly 32 bits, otherwise it is undefined.
 \endtab

\code


#undef USE_ANSI_CLOCK
\endcode
  \tab On a MS-Windows platform,
   %(when the macro \texttt{HAVE\_WINDOWS\_H} is defined),
  the MS-Windows function \texttt{GetProcessTimes} will be used to measure
  the CPU time used by programs (in module \texttt{chrono}).

  On Linux/Unix platforms, if the macro
  \texttt{USE\_ANSI\_CLOCK} is defined, the timers % in module \texttt{chrono}
  will call the ANSI C  \texttt{clock} function. However, on systems
  where the type \texttt{clock\_t} is a 32-bit \texttt{long},
  the time returned
  will wrap around to negative values after about 36 minutes.
  When the macro \texttt{USE\_ANSI\_CLOCK} is undefined, the
  module \texttt{chrono} gets the CPU time used by a program via an 
  alternate non-ANSI C timer 
  based on the POSIX (The Portable Operating System Interface)
  function \texttt{times}, assuming this function is available. The POSIX
  standard is described in the IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 document (see 
  The Open Group web site at
  \url{http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/toc.htm}).
 \endtab
\code


#define DIR_SEPARATOR "/"
\endcode
  \tab Used to separate directories in the pathname of a file.
  It is \texttt{"$/$"} on {Unix-Linux} and most other platforms. 
  It may have to be set to \texttt{"$\backslash\backslash$"} on some platforms.
 \endtab
\code


#undef USE_GMP
\endcode
  \tab  Define this macro if the GNU multi-precision package GMP
  is available.  GMP is a portable library written in C for arbitrary
  precision arithmetic on integers, rational numbers, and floating-point
  numbers. See the Free Software Foundation web site at
  \url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gmp/manual}. A few random number
  generators in library TestU01 use arbitrary large integers, and they
  have been implemented with GMP functions. If one wants to use GMP, the
  GMP header file (\texttt{gmp.h}) must be in the  search path 
  of the C compiler for included files, and the GMP library must be 
  linked to create executable programs.
 \endtab
\code


#undef HAVE_MATHEMATICA
\endcode
  \tab  Define this macro if the {\em Mathematica\/}
% \footnote{
%  {\em Mathematica} is a registered trademark of {\em Wolfram Research,
%   Inc.} Web address:  \texttt{www.wolfram.com}}
    software \cite{mWOL96a}
   and the {\em MathLink} program that allows a C program to call
   functions from {\em Mathematica} are available and you want to use them.
   This is used only in module \texttt{usoft} 
   of library TestU01, where the random number generators from 
   {\em Mathematica} can be called from a C program for testing with TestU01.

   When a C program uses {\em Mathematica}, it must be compiled with the
    options
   \texttt{-I\$MATHINC -L\$MATHLIB -lML}, where 
   \texttt{\$MATHINC} is the path to the header file \texttt{mathlink.h} and 
   \texttt{\$MATHLIB} is the path to the {\em MathLink\/} library \texttt{libML.a}.
   For example, in the environment of our lab, both 
   \texttt{\$MATHINC} and \texttt{\$MATHLIB} must be set to

   \url{<dir>/mathematica/5.0/linux/AddOns/MathLink/DeveloperKit/Linux/CompilerAdditions}.

  To run a main program named \texttt{tulip} on a Unix/Linux platform
  that calls {\em  Mathematica} functions, one may use
 \begin{verse} 
  \texttt{tulip -linkname 'math -mathlink' -linklaunch}.
 \end{verse}
