\defmodule {fres}

This module defines common structures used to keep the results of tests
in the {\tt f} modules. They are described in the detailed version of
this guide.


The argument {\tt res} of each testing function is a structure 
that can keep the test results, i.e. tables of $p$-values, \ldots.
This is useful if one wishes to do something else with the
results or the information generated during a test. 
If one does not want to post-process or use the results after a test,
it suffices to set the {\tt res} argument to the {\tt NULL} pointer.
Then, the structure is created and deleted automatically inside the 
testing function. In any case, the tables of results will be printed
automatically on standard output.
