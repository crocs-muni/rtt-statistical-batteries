\defmodule {sres}

This module defines common structures used to keep the results of tests
in the {\tt s} modules. They are described in the detailed version of
this guide.


The first argument of each testing function is the random number generator 
to be tested. It must be created by calling the appropriate function
in one of the module {\tt u}, and deleted when no longer needed.
The second argument of each testing function is a structure 
{\tt s\ldots\_Res} that can keep the test results (intermediate and final).
This is useful if one wishes to do something else with the
results or the information generated during a test. 
If one does not want to post-process or use the results after a test,
it suffices to set the {\tt \ldots\_Res} argument to the {\tt NULL} pointer.
Then, the structure is created and deleted automatically inside the 
testing function.
