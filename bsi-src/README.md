# Compilation with zig
Zig compiler was used to compile the source on Linux for various platforms: windows, linux, macos
It can be downloaded from its [official download page](https://ziglang.org/download/).
Zig is a standalone binary which can be added into a `PATH` environment variable under a Linux system
and can be easily used from there.
Take a look at `buildall.sh` script to find out how it's done.
